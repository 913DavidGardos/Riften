          <h2>City layout and social dynamic</h2>
          <p class="text-left">

            The entire city is bisected by a large canal that used to serve as access for small cargo boats, but lately
            has fallen into disrepair, decay, and stagnation thanks to the lack of trade during the Civil War. Despite
            this, Riften remains a bustling center of commerce; the Black-Briar Meadery has a near monopoly on the sale
            and distribution of a Nord's favorite pastime: drinking.
          </p>

          <p class="text-left">
            The city is located in the beautiful Autumnal Forest region of Skyrim, and that beauty has encroached upon
            the
            city, in the form of wondrous foliage and generally pleasant, if not sometimes overcast weather. But most of
            Riften's structures are wooden, and the city gives off an old and run-down feeling, which often takes
            visitors
            by surprise. Not that this bothers the residents, who see Riften for what it truly isâ€”a bustling, energetic
            city with a strong economy fueled by hard-working fishermen and mead makers. Despite the fact that the
            current
            Jarl in office is Laila Law-Giver, the residents understand that the city is, for all intents and purposes,
            actually owned and operated by Maven Black-Briar, and in order to survive and thrive, one needs to adhere to
            her rules. Maven's hold over the city is so great, that in the event of an Imperial victory, Maven takes the
            position of Jarl after Laila is removed and banished to live in Windhelm in the Palace of the Kings and
            remarks that it is only as a title, with her son serving as her steward.
          </p>

          <p class="text-left">
            Despite the city's economic strength, it holds a darker side. The home of the notorious Thieves Guild
            in
            Skyrim, Riften also sees much corruption in the form of Maven Black-Briar, especially when dealing with
            rivals. Many poor residents frequent the less desirable areas and thieves, both Guild and freelance, take
            advantage of the frequent mist, dark alleys, and the Canal, preying on travelers and citizens alike. Such
            conditions reflect on the city; deaths are common and people will often fight in the street over dropped
            items.
